    OpenSC is a library for accessing SmartCard devices. It is also
    the core library of the OpenSC project.

    Basic functionality (e.g. SELECT FILE, READ BINARY) should work on
    any ISO 7816-4 compatible SmartCard.  Encryption and decryption
    using private keys on the SmartCard is possible with PKCS #15
    compatible cards, such as the FINEID (Finnish Electronic IDentity)
    card.

    <flag name='dnie'>
      Add support for the spanish ID card. This patch builds the card
      driver into opensc so it may cause issues with other drivers,
      unless you want to test it with other cards or need to use a dnie
      you shouldn't enable it.
    </flag>

    <flag name='libtool'>
      Use <pkg>sys-devel/libtool</pkg> for dynamically loading libraries
      rather than the host libdl/dlopen helpers.
    </flag>

    <flag name='openct'>
      Use <pkg>dev-libs/openct</pkg> (and CT-API) for accessing
      Smartcard hardware. If neither openct nor pcsc-lite are enabled,
      only CT-API dynamic linking is enabled.
    </flag>

    <flag name='pcsc-lite'>
      Use <pkg>sys-apps/pcsc-lite</pkg> (and PC/SC API) for accessing
      Smartcard hardware. If neither openct nor pcsc-lite are enabled,
      only CT-API dynamic linking is enabled.
